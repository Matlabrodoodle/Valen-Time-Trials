# Valen-Time-Trials
Hello there! 

Welcome to the Valen-Time Trials, a collection of romantic mini-games where you complete various tasks in an effort to
make the perfect Valentine's Day for that special someone!

To play simply find the file entitled "final_game.py" and run it. Enjoy!
NOTE: the final_game.py in the zip has a section of code commented out that shouldn't be; replace it with the version I uploaded separately for full functionality

Team roles were as follows:
Lead Programmer: Alvito DiStefano
Music Composer: Gabriel Pinciotti
Graphics Artists: Justin Ames and William Engle
